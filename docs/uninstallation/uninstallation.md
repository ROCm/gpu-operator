# Uninstall

To remove the operator and related resources, you need to follow specific sequence to remove them.

1. `DeviceConfig` custom resources
2. Helm Charts or OLM bundle
3. Custom resource definition

## Uninstall Custom Resource

To delete the `Deviceconfig`, you can use either one of the methods:

* use existing YAML file: ```kubectl delete -f deviceconfigs.yaml```
* query the cluster and delete by resource metadata:
  ```kubectl delete deviceconfigs <your-deviceconfig-name> -n kube-amd-gpu```
* simply remove all deviceconfigs in the namespace:
  ```kubectl delete deviceconfigs --all -n kube-amd-gpu```

Once the deletion was triggered, if out-of-tree driver was previously installed by AMD GPU operator, it will trigger KMM to send worker pods to selected nodes and start to unload the `amdgpu` kernel module.

The delete request won't finish immediately, instead it will wait for the unload confirmation from all selected worker nodes, then finish the deletion of the `DeviceConfig` resource.

If delete request gets stuck for too long, you may need to check the status of KMM worker pods, if any error happened please check the worker pod error logs:

```kubectl logs kmm-worker -n kube-amd-gpu```

or refer to [Troubleshooting](../troubleshooting) document to find the solution.

## Uninstall Helm Charts

```bash
helm uninstall amd-gpu-operator -n kube-amd-gpu --debug
```

By default the helm uninstall command will call a pre-delete hook to delete all the existing `DeviceConfig` in the cluster for all namespaces.

```{note}
The pre-delete hook is using the operator controller image to run kubectl for checking existing `DeviceConfig`, if you want to skip the pre-delete hook, you can run helm uninstall command with ```--no-hooks``` option, in that way the Helm Charts will be immediately uninstalled but may have risk that some `DeviceConfig` resources still remain in the cluster.
```

## Uninstall OLM Bundle

* Web Console:

If you installed AMD GPU operator by the OperatorHub webconsole, you can go back to the webconsole and use the console to uninstall the OLM bundle

* OpenShift CLI:

Please use CLI to delete the subscription and CSV resource for AMD GPU operator. The example commands are:

```bash
oc delete subscription amd-gpu-operator -n openshift-operators
oc delete clusterserviceversion amd-gpu-operator.v1.0.0 -n openshift-operators
```

## Uninstall Custom Resource Definition

By default Helm Charts are using a post-delete hook to uninstall the CRDs for users. If the Helm Charts uninstallation was running with ```--no-hooks``` you may need to manually clean up CRDs after uninstalling the Helm Charts. To list all existing CRDs, run this command:

```bash
$ kubectl get crds
NAME                                     CREATED AT
certificaterequests.cert-manager.io      2024-08-20T00:29:12Z
certificates.cert-manager.io             2024-08-20T00:29:12Z
challenges.acme.cert-manager.io          2024-08-20T00:29:12Z
clusterissuers.cert-manager.io           2024-08-20T00:29:12Z
deviceconfigs.amd.com                    2024-10-29T19:39:37Z
issuers.cert-manager.io                  2024-08-20T00:29:12Z
modules.kmm.sigs.x-k8s.io                2024-10-29T19:39:37Z
nodefeaturegroups.nfd.k8s-sigs.io        2024-10-29T19:39:37Z
nodefeaturerules.nfd.k8s-sigs.io         2024-10-29T19:39:37Z
nodefeatures.nfd.k8s-sigs.io             2024-10-29T19:39:37Z
nodemodulesconfigs.kmm.sigs.x-k8s.io     2024-10-29T19:39:37Z
orders.acme.cert-manager.io              2024-08-20T00:29:12Z
preflightvalidations.kmm.sigs.x-k8s.io   2024-10-29T22:53:39Z
```

then use kubectl to delete CRDs that need to be deleted:

```bash
kubectl delete crds deviceconfigs.amd.com
```

```{warning}
Carefully evaluate the impact of removing all CRDs. If the CRDs of cert-manager, NFD or KMM are being used by operators other than AMD GPU operator, deleting those CRDs may affect other operators.
```
